# open-HAT-PCIe
A open source boring board, converting the Pi's PCIe HAT into a PCIe x1 card. 

I have too many Raspberry Pi hats. Occasionally, I wish to debug them on an x86 computer, which gave birth to the idea of creating an adapter board. Thus, the **open HAT-PCIe** was born.

The board has 4 areas: PCIe x1 gold finger, 12V to 5V DC power area, Pi 5 PCIe connector, and Pi 5 HAT installation area

The wiring definition of the FPC connector is identical to that of the Raspberry Pi 5, please pay attention to the installation direction.
